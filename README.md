## **Overview**

"The Second Mind" is a Streamlit-based web application that simulates a system of AI agents designed to mimic human learning. The app processes user input, generates hypotheses, refines them iteratively, and improves over multiple cycles. It incorporates real-time web scraping, text generation, and feedback-driven improvement to achieve its goals.

The system consists of six specialized agents:
1. **Generation Agent**: Creates initial hypotheses based on user input and web data.
2. **Reflection Agent**: Checks the coherence of hypotheses with web data.
3. **Ranking Agent**: Scores hypotheses based on relevance and length.
4. **Evolution Agent**: Refines hypotheses iteratively.
5. **Proximity Agent**: Links to past interactions for context.
6. **Meta-Review Agent**: Evaluates the process and suggests improvements.

## **Features**

- **Real-Time Web Scraping**: Fetches data from multiple sources (e.g., Wikipedia, ScienceDaily, PubMed) to inform hypotheses.
- **Text Generation**: Uses Hugging Face's `transformers` library (GPT-2) to generate hypotheses.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Runs 2â€“3 cycles to refine hypotheses and improve scores.
- **Data Visualization**: Plots the improvement in scores over cycles using Matplotlib.
- **Persistent Storage**: Stores past interactions in an SQLite database for recall and context.
